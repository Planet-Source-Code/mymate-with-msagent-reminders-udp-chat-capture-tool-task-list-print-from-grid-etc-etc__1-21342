### Description

It is a DeskTop Task/Reminder Manager. You need to have MSagent and some characters installed. It has a simple UDP chat program. It also has some nice Capture tools (Screen Active Form etc etc) I got the capture code from someone else...can't remember. It has a Task Manager and a Reminder Manager. The Agent is selectable and keeps making snotty remarks. It lives in the IconTray. REALLY HANDY program to keep track of you "To Do" list. Please comment...thanx
